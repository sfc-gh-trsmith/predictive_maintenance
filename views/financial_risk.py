# VIEW SPECIFICATION: Financial Risk Drill-Down
# ==================================================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   - To quantify and visualize the financial risk associated with potential asset failures.
#   - Allows users to identify which types of assets and which specific machines pose the
#     greatest financial threat to the operation.
#
# DATA SOURCES:
#   - Primary: `HYPERFORGE.GOLD.AGG_ASSET_HOURLY_HEALTH`
#     - This table provides the core risk factors (failure probability, RUL) in a pre-aggregated
#       format for maximum performance.
#   - Secondary: `HYPERFORGE.SILVER` Layer
#     - `DIM_ASSET`: Joined to get asset names and the crucial `DOWNTIME_IMPACT_PER_HOUR` value.
#     - `DIM_ASSET_CLASS`: Joined to get the descriptive name for each asset category.
#
# FUNCTIONALITY & DRILL PATH:
#   1. Risk Contribution by Asset Class (Level 1):
#      - The view calculates the "Production at Risk" for every asset.
#      - It then aggregates this risk by asset class and displays it in a treemap, making it
#        easy to see which categories (e.g., "CNC Machines") contribute the most risk.
#   2. Critical Asset Matrix (Level 2):
#      - A dropdown allows the user to filter the view to a single asset class.
#      - The view then renders a bubble chart (risk matrix) for all assets in that class.
#      - This matrix plots Failure Probability vs. Financial Impact, with bubble size indicating
#        urgency (e.g., tied to risk amount). Assets in the top-right quadrant are the most critical.
#   3. Asset Action Plan (Level 3):
#      - Based on the matrix, the view automatically identifies the single highest-risk asset
#        in the selected category and displays a summary "Action Plan" card with key stats (RUL,
#        Failure Probability) and a recommended action.
#
# VISUALIZATIONS:
#   - `plotly.express.treemap`: Used to show the proportional risk contribution of each asset class.
#   - `plotly.express.scatter`: Used to render the interactive bubble chart (risk matrix).
#
# USER INTERACTION:
#   - `st.selectbox`: Allows the user to filter the risk matrix by asset class.
#   - Interactive Charts: The user can hover over the treemap and bubble chart segments to
#     see detailed tooltips with specific values.
